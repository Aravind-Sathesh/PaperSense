üìö PaperSense: AI Research Assistant

PaperSense is an intelligent, local-first application designed to help researchers, students, and professionals understand complex scientific documents. By leveraging a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, users can "chat" with their PDFs, asking nuanced questions and receiving accurate, source-verified answers.

This project goes beyond a standard RAG implementation by incorporating an advanced **two-stage retrieval process with a cross-encoder re-ranker** to ensure the highest quality context is provided to the language model.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Interactive Chat Interface:** Upload one or more PDFs and ask questions in natural language.
-   **Local-First & Private:** Powered by Ollama and local models like Mistral, ensuring your documents and queries never leave your machine.
-   **Advanced Two-Stage Retrieval:**
    1.  **Fast Initial Search:** Uses a FAISS vector store for efficient semantic search.
    2.  **Intelligent Re-Ranking:** Employs a `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` cross-encoder to re-rank initial results for maximum relevance, significantly reducing noise.
-   **Trustworthy & Explainable:** Every answer is accompanied by a "View Sources" dropdown, showing the exact text chunks from the original document used to generate the response.
-   **Robust & Grounded:** Utilizes a carefully engineered prompt template to minimize hallucinations and force the LLM to answer only based on the provided context.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

PaperSense is built on a modern, modular RAG architecture that emphasizes quality and control.

```

The data flows through the following pipeline:

1.  **PDF Ingestion:** Documents are loaded and parsed using `PyPDFLoader`.
2.  **Chunking:** Text is split into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
3.  **Embedding:** The text chunks are converted into numerical vectors using a local `GPT4AllEmbeddings` model.
4.  **Vector Storage:** The embeddings are stored in a `FAISS` in-memory vector store for fast retrieval.
5.  **Retrieval & Re-Ranking:**
    -   A user query triggers the `FAISS` store to retrieve the top 10 potentially relevant chunks (wide net).
    -   The `CrossEncoderReranker` then re-scores these 10 chunks for their specific relevance to the query, selecting the top 3.
6.  **Augmented Generation:** The top 3 re-ranked chunks are combined with the chat history and a strict prompt template, then fed to the `Ollama` (Mistral) LLM.
7.  **Answer & Sources:** The LLM generates an answer, which is then presented to the user along with the source chunks for verification.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/PaperSense.git
    cd PaperSense
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Pull the necessary Ollama model:**
    ```bash
